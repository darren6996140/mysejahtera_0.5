Task:
The app is to include the basic features listed below:
For public user:
1. Sign up an account with their personal information (e.g., name, age, ID, phone, postcode, address, etc.), [DONE]
2. Login to enter/update medical history, Covid-19 status (i.e., under-quarantine or normal) and occupations. [DONE]
3. Login to check their appointment date, time and location. [DONE]
4. Login to R.S.V.P to the assigned appointment (i.e., yes or no). [DONE]

For administrator, login to:
1. Categorize the public users into high-risk or low-risk based on their medical history. [DONE]
2. Categorize the public users into priority ranking (1 to 5, with higher the value higher priority) based on their occupations. [DONE]
3. Create vaccination centers: location and capacity per hour (i.e., how many individuals can be vaccinated in an hour). [DONE]
4. Set appointment for public users by assigning vaccination center with specific date and time. [DONE]
5. Sort the public users according to their postcode, age, Covid-19 status, priority, group, etc. [DONE]
6. Generate the list of assigned appointments for a vaccination center and sorted by date and time, containing users’ name, ID, RSVP, phone and risk group. [DONE]

Some advance features (but not limited to the list below):
1. To auto-categorize the public users into high-risk and low-risk group based on medical history (and skip no. 1 (admin)) and/or priority ranking based on occupation (and skip no. 2 (admin)). [DONE]
2. Auto-assigned appointment when new vaccination slot/date/center is made available by the administrator. [N/A]
3. To check if a vaccination center has empty slots (certain date and time has not reached the maximum capacity) and/or over-booking (number of appointments are more than the capacity) and notify the administrators. [N/A]
4. To store all available data in persistent storage file (or text file). [DONE]
5. Graphical user interface. [N/A]
Extra: 1. Hashing passwords. [DONE]

Deliverables
You are to submit the following for this assignment:

Your source code must be able to be interpreted without errors with Python 3.9 Interpreter or later. If your source code cannot be interpreted, you get ZERO for everything except report (refer to the mark sheet in the last page for details).

Presentation:
Assignment presentation is to be held in week 14. Each group will be given 10 minutes to present their program, follow by 5 minutes Q&A. Please practice and time your presentation.
You need to attend the presentation to justify your contribution and work. Those who are absent from the presentation will get ZERO mark for the whole assignment.
To make testing easier and save time during presentation, your program shall have the following features:
i. Never clear screen.
ii. Pre-load with at least 20 public users (when the program starts). [DONE]
iii. Pre-load with at least 3 vaccination centers, each with at least 3 assigned appointment. [DONE]
iv. Pre-load with at least an administrator.    [DONE]
v. Pre-load with at least 3 users each in various postcode, age, risk groups and priority groups. [DONE]
You tutor will announce the arrangement and timeslot for the presentation.

Plagiarism [DONE (no way in hell)] 
It is fine to seek help from friends or from online resources when you do the assignment, However, seeking help should not go overboard, to the point of getting (or even paying) someone to complete the assignment partly or fully for you, copying from online resources without understanding, or doing any means with the intention to cheat. For this assignment, plagiarism means the following:
(a) Turning in a work that, from the examiner’s point of view, you do not sufficiently understand.
(b) Turning in someone else’s work (whether partly or fully) as your own.
(c) To use another’s work (whether partly or fully) without crediting the source.
(d) Any means of cheating.
